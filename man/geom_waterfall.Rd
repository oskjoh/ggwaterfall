\title{geom_waterfall

Creates a ggplot that makes a smooth rank over time. To change the `smooth`
argument you need to put it outside of the `aes` of the geom. Uses the x and y aestethics.
Usually you want to compare multiple lines and if so, use the `color` aestethic.
To change the direction of the curve to 'vertical' set `direction = "y`}
\usage{
geom_waterfall(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  geom = "rect",
  position = "identity",
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE,
  grand_total = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{provide you own mapping. both x and y need to be numeric.}

\item{data}{provide you own data}

\item{geom}{change geom}

\item{position}{change position}

\item{na.rm}{remove missing values}

\item{show.legend}{show legend in plot}

\item{inherit.aes}{should the geom inherits aestethics}

\item{...}{other arguments to be passed to the geom}

\item{smooth}{how much smooth should the curve have? More means steeper curve.}

\item{direction}{the character x or y depending of smoothing direction}
}
